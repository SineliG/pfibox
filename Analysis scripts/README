These are analysis scripts and sample data files.  Their usage is outlined
below, and can be used when following along with the Nature Protocol methods.
The script 'analysisCode.R' will use the raw 'timecourse_results.csv' file, and
the 'legend.txt' file to produce a 'gfpData.Rdata' list file for importing into
the R statistical programming language.  The 'timecourse_results.csv' file is
the output of a MOPS minimal medium screen using the E. coli K-12 MG1655
promoter-reporter libary of Zaslaver et al 
(https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth895).

When using 'analysisCode.R', follow the instructions in the header of the script
file, but please update 'timecourse_results.csv' to your locally-produced file,
as the file in the GitHub repository is the sample data.  Also include your own
'legend.txt' file, as the file from the GitHub repository corresponds to the 
promoter-reporter library used in the original Cell Systems paper
